# Sandwich Maker

## Summary of Project:
- In this project, we took our existing iife sandwich project and  browserified it.  We had to use the Grunt file for linting and used multiple resources to pull data into the project.  The end goal was to have it look and function the same way IIFE Sandwich Maker did.

### Directions: Browserify Your Sandwich Maker

### Setup

Follow your own set of setup instructions for Broswerify.

#### Requirements:

- Convert your Sandwich Maker code to use CommonJS module pattern instead of the IIFE pattern and have a Grunt task for compiling your modules.
Use XHR to load JSON files for each type of topping/bread.
- Implied requirements: Lint your JS (we should get no errors if we run Grunt), informative README.md
